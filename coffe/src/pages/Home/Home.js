      <p>Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, 
        the seeds of berries from certain Coffea species. From the coffee fruit, 
        the seeds are separated to produce a stable, raw product: unroasted green coffee. 
        The seeds are then roasted, a process which transforms them into a consumable product: 
        roasted coffee, which is ground into fine particles that are typically steeped in hot water before being filtered out, producing a cup of coffee.</p>
